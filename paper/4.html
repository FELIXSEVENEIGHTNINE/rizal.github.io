                His essays, such as “The Indolence of the Filipinos,” debunked colonial stereotypes and argued that the Filipinos’ perceived laziness was a result of systemic oppression, 
                not inherent weakness. These works inspired the Propaganda Movement, a group of Filipino intellectuals in Europe who sought reforms through peaceful means, and later, the 
                revolutionary movement back home.

                Before the revolution, Rizal was a key figure in the Propaganda Movement, which aimed to advocate for reforms within the Spanish colonial system. The movement’s mouthpiece,
                 La Solidaridad, published essays and articles demanding equal rights, representation in the Spanish Cortes, and an end to abuses by friars and colonial officials.

            <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;">
                Rizal’s contributions to La Solidaridad included essays like “The Philippines: A Century Hence,” where he predicted the eventual collapse of Spanish rule and urged Filipinos 
                to prepare for self-governance. Although the Propaganda Movement failed to achieve its goals, it united Filipinos abroad and planted the seeds of revolution.

                In 1892, José Rizal returned to the Philippines and established La Liga Filipina, a civic organization focused on uniting Filipinos and advocating for reforms through peaceful 
                means. The league aimed to create a united Filipino nation, promote education and civic responsibility, and push for legal and economic reforms. However, the Spanish authorities
                 viewed Rizal’s activities as a threat to their colonial rule. Just days after founding the organization, he was arrested and exiled to Dapitan, where he spent four years in 
                 isolation. Despite this setback, La Liga Filipina inspired its members, including Andrés Bonifacio, to pursue more radical paths toward Philippine independence.

                The Philippine Revolution continued after Rizal’s death, culminating in the declaration of independence on June 12, 1898, in Kawit, Cavite. Although the revolution initially 
                succeeded in ending Spanish rule, the Philippines soon faced a new colonial power: the United States. Rizal’s legacy, however, endured. His ideas about nationalism, education, 
                and civic responsibility became the foundation of the Philippine Republic. His life and works continue to inspire Filipinos to fight for justice, equality, and true independence.

            <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;">
                As the revolution gained momentum, Rizal’s fate was sealed. Despite being in exile and having no direct involvement in the Katipunan’s activities, he was accused of inciting 
                rebellion. On December 30, 1896, Rizal was executed by firing squad in Bagumbayan (now Luneta Park). His martyrdom became a rallying cry for the revolution. Rizal’s death 
                galvanized Filipinos, proving that the fight for freedom required sacrifice. His final poem, “Mi Ultimo Adios” (My Last Farewell), expressed his unwavering love for his 
                country and his hope for its future.
